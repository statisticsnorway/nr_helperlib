## What is this repo?
Simply put, it is a bunch of functions mean to simplify working with national accounts. As such it contains elements that do many of things we repeat endlessly in our production programs (data i/o, filtering, joining, simple operations with numpy). 

Includes tools for aggregation and disaggregation of time series based on FAME's functionalities for timeseries.

For a short intro on functionalities and required libraries for operation of functions, see the readme files inside each function folder.
